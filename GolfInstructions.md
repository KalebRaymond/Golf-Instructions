# Introduction  
Did your boss just ask you to take some clients out on the links? Are you worried of making a fool of yourself out on the course? Below are the instructions for playing a hole of golf. No prior golf knowledge is required.  
# Theory  
Hitting the ball towards the flag located on the green in minimal shots is the goal.

**Flying projectiles and swinging clubs can cause serious or fatal injury.** 
# Steps  
  
### 1. Tee shot club selection  
* Check the par of the hole on the score card.
* For holes with a par 4 or greater, select the driver. (Skip to step 8 for a par 3)
  
### 2. Determine order of tee shots  
**Note:** if playing alone, skip this step
* Stand in a circle and flip a tee if this is the first hole. Whoever the tee points to will take the first shot. Repeat this step until the order is set.
* If the hole number is greater than 1, the player who scored the lowest on the last hole goes first.
  
### 3. Teeing up the ball  
* Take tee from pocket.
* Push tee into ground so that the top is 1.5 inches above the grass.
* Balance the golf ball on top of the level tee.
  
### 4. Grasping the club  
**Note:** left handed players should replace *"right hand"* with *"left hand"*
* Grab the club with only the left hand, extending the thumb along the shaft and resting the palm as close to the back end as possible.
* With the right hand, grasp the club and overlap your left thumb.
  
### 5. Swinging the club  
**Note:** take practice swings before hitting the golf ball.

* Place the head of the club adjacent to the ball without touching it.
* Spread legs about shoulder width apart and stand a comfortable distance from the ball.
* With uniform speed and control, bring the club in an arc motion above the head and then down upon the ball.
* Once contact is made with the ball, make sure to follow through with the club head.
  
### 6. Watching the ball  
**Note:** Sunglasses can help locating the flight of the golf ball.
* After hitting the ball, pick your head up and look against the sky for the ball, following its flight.
* Take note of where the ball landed.
  
### 7. Finding the ball  
* Drive or walk with your clubs to the general area where the ball landed.
* Search for the ball until it is located.
  
### 8. Approach shot club selection  
**Note:** effective club choices may vary per individual.
* Measure or estimate the distance of the golf ball to the flag.
* Choose a pitching wedge, sand wedge, or higher degree club for a distance of 75 yards or less. Else, choose a numbered iron (lower irons for longer distances).
* Pull the club out of the bag.
* repeat step 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 until the ball is on the green.
  
### 9. Putting  
* Pull out the putter from your bag.
* Get low and note the slope of the green and predict the break of the golf ball accordingly.
* Stand up and place the head of the putter next to the ball, aim toward the hole.
* Swing the club like a pendulum at the ball and strike it.
* Repeat step 9 until the ball falls into the hole.
  
### 10. Finishing the hole  
* Grab the ball out of the hole.
* move off the green and follow the cart path to the next hole.
* repeat steps 1-10 until your wife calls.
